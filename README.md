# Assignment #11: Colour Changer

**This assignment is a webpage that allows the user to change and customize the colours of the elements. View this project at: walker.rout.ca**

## Getting Started With the Project

> This project is written in a local style, meaning that I have not set it up on any domain. If you would like to run this project, download the files, and set them them up inside a new, empty directory. Open up the *"index.html"* file located in the main directory in a web browser (this is achieved by either right clicking the file and launching with a certain web browser, or opening up a web browser page and dragging the file into it). Doing this will display the project's main web page.

### Using the Webpage

The function of this webpage is the ability to change and customize the colours of the elements within it. To do this, one must scroll to the bottom of the webpage, and locate the buttons that depict the areas on the webpage (Background, Left Side, Middle, Right Side). After clicking on one of these buttons, the corresponding element will be selected. Once the element is selected, modifications are enable by pressing on the 4 buttons located beneath the element selection (Red, Blue, Green, Yellow). By pressing on one of these coloured buttons, one can change the colour of the element previously selected. If one wants to reset the webpage, all they have to do is click the ```**RESET**``` button.
